## How-To

- Flash official i9100 TWRP on your device by any means you see fit.
  - If already running TWRP:
    - In TWRP click 'Install', click 'Install Image', select the downloaded '.img' file, and select the recovery partition.
  - If not running TWRP, any of these options should work:
    - Follow official i9100 TWRP install instructions using Heimdall.
    - Follow 'Installing TWRP 3 the Easy Way' instructions [here] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/orig-development/isorec-isolated-recovery-galaxy-s2-t3291176).
    - Install any old unofficial TWRP for your device, then upgrade using the '.img' file.
- Flash a TWRP patcher for your device.
- Reboot recovery.

The patchers are available [here] (https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=54334). The standard version will only let you flash packages for your device. The crossflash version will additionally let you flash packages for the i9100. Use crossflash at your own risk.

## Limitations

Some keys in the front of the device might not work. But note that they are not needed in TWRP.
